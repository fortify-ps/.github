# GitHub Fortify-PS organization

Build secure software fast with [Fortify](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/solutions/application-security). Fortify offers end-to-end application security solutions with the flexibility of testing on-premises and on-demand to scale and cover the entire software development lifecycle.  With Fortify, find security issues early and fix at the speed of DevOps. 

This organization used to contain many repositories developed by Fortify Professional Services, however most of these repositories have now been moved to the main Fortify organization at https://github.com/fortify. The following repositories are planned to be moved to the main Fortify organization as well over the coming weeks/months, either as-is or after some restructuring:

* [FortifySyncFoDToSSC](https://github.com/fortify-ps/FortifySyncFoDToSSC)
* [FortifyBugTrackerUtility](https://github.com/fortify-ps/FortifyBugTrackerUtility)
* [fortify-ssc-bugtracker-register-buglinks](https://github.com/fortify-ps/fortify-ssc-bugtracker-register-buglinks)
* [BugTrackerPluginALMOctane](https://github.com/fortify-ps/BugTrackerPluginALMOctane)

Other repositories will either remain in the Fortify-PS organization, or are subject to final decision on whether to move them or not. Eventually, the Fortify-PS organization will only contain repositories that are outdated or sandbox/incubation projects. At that time, the repositories in this organization may be moved to a Fortify-Sandbox organization.
